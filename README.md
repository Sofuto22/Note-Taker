# Note Taker

## Description

My project was created in order to make a Note Take application for a business owner so they can write and save notes. Currently I am unable to get the project to run on heroku. I am hoping that some feed back will give me an idea for the errors I am running in to. When I look up the error it gives me a 503 server error.

## Installation

Install npm i

## Usage

Should be open the delpoyed website and hit the get started button, but I have no made it to that point yet.
